        <h1>Understanding an Uploaded Build</h1>
        <p>When you browse Destiny 101, you will encounter various builds uploaded by other players. Here's a guide to help you understand how to read and evaluate these builds.</p>

        <h2>Key Components of an Uploaded Build</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Build Name:</strong> Each build has a unique name that usually represents the subclass or theme of the build (e.g., "Strand Hunter" or "Void Warlock"). The name gives a quick idea of the build’s purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Subclass:</strong> Every build is linked to a specific subclass (Hunter, Warlock, Titan). This indicates the class abilities and playstyle that the build is designed around. A build may be tailored for a specific subclass like "Solar Titan" or "Stasis Warlock."</li>
            <li><strong>Exotic Armor:</strong> Exotic armor pieces are often a key feature of builds. These armor pieces provide unique bonuses and synergize with the subclass abilities. Check the description for which exotic armor is used and how it enhances the build (e.g., "One-Eyed Mask" for Titans or "Starfire Protocol" for Warlocks).</li>
            <li><strong>Description:</strong> The description is the heart of the build. It explains how to use the build effectively, including specific strategies, weapon choices, and tips. Pay attention to how the exotic armor and subclass abilities work together to achieve maximum efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Submitted By:</strong> This section tells you who uploaded the build. You can learn about the creator’s experience level and their preferences, which may give you context for how the build is designed to be played.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Evaluate an Uploaded Build</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Synergy:</strong> The most important thing to look at is how well the exotic armor, subclass, and weapons synergize. A well-designed build will have clear synergies between abilities and equipment. For example, a "Hunter Strand" build might focus on maximizing mobility while using Strand abilities and a certain exotic armor.</li>
            <li><strong>Playstyle:</strong> Every player has a different playstyle. Some builds focus on high damage output, while others prioritize survivability or support. Consider the build's strengths and weaknesses based on your own playstyle. If you're a PvP player, look for builds that enhance damage or survivability in the Crucible.</li>
            <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Some builds are easy to use and beginner-friendly, while others might require advanced knowledge of Destiny mechanics. Read through the description to gauge the difficulty level of the build.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> If you find that a build is almost perfect but needs a slight tweak, consider customizing it to fit your preferences. You may swap out a weapon or mod, or experiment with a different exotic armor piece to suit your playstyle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Use a Build</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Once you’ve found a build you like, start by understanding how to activate and use the subclass abilities effectively. Each subclass has different abilities and skills, so familiarize yourself with these first.</li>
            <li>Make sure to equip the recommended exotic armor and weapons mentioned in the build. This will help you maximize the build's potential.</li>
            <li>After you’ve tried the build in action, you might want to adjust it. Feel free to modify some aspects to suit your preferences or the situation you're facing in-game (PvP vs. PvE).</li>
        </ul>
