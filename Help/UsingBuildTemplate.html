        <h1>How to Use the Build Template</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Destiny 101 build template help page! This page will guide you through the different sections of the build template, so you can properly fill it out and create your own build.</p>

        <h2>Template Overview</h2>
        <p>The build template is divided into three main sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gameplay Loop</strong>: A brief explanation of how the build is played in-game. This section describes the general approach to using the build, including tips on how to maximize its effectiveness in both PvP and PvE environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Loadout Image</strong>: An image that represents your build, showing the equipment and mods you're using. Make sure to choose a clear image that highlights the essential parts of your loadout.</li>
            <li><strong>Armor Mods</strong>: A detailed list of armor mods you recommend for each armor piece (Helmet, Gauntlets, Chest, Legs, Class Item). This section should include the specific mods you’re using to enhance the build's performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Detailed Section Breakdown</h2>
        
        <h3>Gameplay Loop</h3>
        <p>The "Gameplay Loop" section is where you explain the core of your build. In this section, describe the tactics and strategies players should follow to use the build effectively. Include things like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to activate subclass abilities and what to prioritize.</li>
            <li>The most efficient way to manage your energy and cooldowns.</li>
            <li>Suggestions for how to approach combat based on the build's strengths (e.g., offense, defense, mobility).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Loadout Image</h3>
        <p>The "Loadout Image" section is where you showcase the look of your build. You can upload an image of your character showing the armor and mods you've chosen. Make sure to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a clear image with your character in their full loadout.</li>
            <li>Ensure the image is cropped properly and not too cluttered, so it's easy for others to understand what equipment you're using.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're unsure which image to choose, use a simple image showing the gear and weapons you're using in action.</p>

        <h3>Armor Mods</h3>
        <p>In the "Armor Mods" section, you'll list the specific mods for each piece of armor. The sections are divided by armor type (Helmet, Gauntlets, Chest, Legs, and Class Item). Here’s how to fill it out:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Helmet:</strong> List any mods that you’ve equipped for your helmet. These could be mods that increase ability regeneration, enhance resistances, or provide special bonuses.</li>
            <li><strong>Gauntlets:</strong> List mods related to your gauntlets that complement your build’s playstyle, such as mods for boosting reload speed or weapon handling.</li>
            <li><strong>Chest:</strong> Mention mods that are important for your chest piece, such as defensive mods or buffs to specific abilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Legs:</strong> If you’ve chosen any mobility, recovery, or resistance mods for your legs, include them here.</li>
            <li><strong>Class Item:</strong> Don’t forget to list any mods you’ve used for your class item. These mods can be important for boosting subclass abilities or enhancing your energy regeneration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Best Practices for Creating a Build</h2>
        <p>Here are some additional tips when submitting a build using the template:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be clear and concise:</strong> Make sure each section provides valuable information without overloading it with unnecessary details.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance your loadout:</strong> Try to balance your build between offense, defense, and utility to cover different playstyles and situations.</li>
            <li><strong>Test your build:</strong> Always test your build before submitting it. Make sure the gameplay loop works as expected, and the armor mods complement each other well.</li>
        </ul>
