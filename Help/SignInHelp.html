        <p>If you're having trouble signing in to your account on Destiny 101, don't worry! Here's a guide to help you troubleshoot common issues and get back into your account.</p>

        <h2>Common Sign-In Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Forgot Username or Email:</strong> If you've forgotten your username or email, try checking your inbox for past confirmation or notification emails from Destiny 101. If you can't find them, you can reach out via the <a href="contactMe.html">Contact Us</a> page for further assistance.</li>
            <li><strong>Forgot Password:</strong> If you’ve forgotten your password, click the "Forgot Password" link on the sign-in page. Follow the instructions to reset your password via email.</li>
            <li><strong>Incorrect Credentials:</strong> Double-check that your username and password are correct. Be sure to use the correct case (capital letters matter) and avoid any extra spaces before or after the text.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Locked:</strong> If you’ve attempted to sign in too many times with the wrong credentials, your account may be temporarily locked for security reasons. Wait 30 minutes before trying again, or contact support for further assistance.</li>
            <li><strong>Browser Issues:</strong> Clear your browser cache and cookies or try using an alternative browser. This can help resolve issues related to login forms not loading properly.</li>
