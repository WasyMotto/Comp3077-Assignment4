    <p>
      Destiny 101 is a fan-made project created to help new and returning Guardians explore creative loadouts and subclass builds in <strong>Destiny 2</strong>. Whether you're a Hunter, Warlock, or Titan, this site offers curated builds across all subclasses—including Prismatic—to help you optimize your playstyle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each class page includes featured builds submitted by players like you. From ability synergy to exotic armor combos, we aim to give players the tools and ideas they need to tackle everything from casual strikes to Grandmaster Nightfalls.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Made This</h2>
    <p>
      As a long-time Destiny player, I’ve always enjoyed building unique loadouts and sharing them with friends. This site is my way of organizing that knowledge, while giving the community a space to contribute their own builds and creativity.
    </p>

    <h2>Submit Your Build</h2>
    <p>

      <a href="Forms/buildSubmissionForm.html" class="button">Build Submission Form</a>.
      Your submission might be featured on one of the class pages!
